This is just a quick re-visit of a modified MEAN stack that implements a few extras like Express 4.x, social sign-on, Mongoose promises, a cleaner Routes interface, etc. 

The app itself has a simple goal to capture and communicate the strengths work-style preferences of team members. The "About" section of the app contains a full readout on the inspiration and architecture. 

Another perk of this hobby project was performing a full dive into the capabilities of Grunt. I'd typically used Grunt to automate production builds, but this time took several extra steps to automate the web dev environment as well.
